## July 2023

In July and August 2023, we are running 2600 in the Unplugged mode.  
That means:  
- no recordings  
- multiple talks on different subjects  
- talks are limited to 15 minutes  
- beer, pizza, fun

## What was on the meetup

- [@Sergei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergei-zaiats/) presented about `building a home malware analysys lab`   
- [@klausagnoletti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnoletti/) hosted an amazing session of [Backdoors & Breaches, an Incident Response Card Game](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/)
